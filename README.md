# MATLAB to Python Migration Plan for BCDI Processing

## Introduction

This document outlines the migration plan for transitioning a MATLAB-based BCDI (Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging) processing workflow to Python. The goal is to gradually replace MATLAB code with Python equivalents, leveraging the compatibility between the two languages.

## Objectives

1. **Compatibility**: Ensure seamless integration between MATLAB and Python code.
2. **Gradual Transition**: Replace MATLAB code with Python incrementally.
3. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure that the BCDI processing workflow remains functional throughout the transition.

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Setup Python Environment

- **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on the system.
- **Install Required Libraries**: Install necessary Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, h5py, and PyMAT.

### Step 2: MATLAB Engine API for Python

- **Install MATLAB Engine API**: Install the MATLAB Engine API for Python to enable calling MATLAB functions from Python.
- **Initialize MATLAB Engine**: Initialize the MATLAB engine in Python scripts.

### Step 3: Identify Core MATLAB Functions

- **List Core Functions**: Identify the core MATLAB functions used in the BCDI processing workflow.
- **Document Functionality**: Document the functionality of each core function.

### Step 4: Call MATLAB Functions from Python

- **Create Python Wrapper**: Create Python wrapper functions to call MATLAB core functions.
- **Test Integration**: Test the integration of MATLAB functions called from Python to ensure functionality is maintained.

### Step 5: Replace MATLAB Functions with Python Equivalents

- **Select Functions for Replacement**: Choose MATLAB functions to replace with Python equivalents.
- **Implement Python Equivalents**: Implement Python functions that replicate the functionality of the selected MATLAB functions.
- **Test Python Functions**: Test the new Python functions to ensure they perform the same tasks as the MATLAB functions.

### Step 6: Iterate and Expand

- **Repeat Replacement Process**: Continue replacing MATLAB functions with Python equivalents, gradually expanding the Python codebase.
- **Refactor Code**: Refactor Python code for readability, efficiency, and maintainability.

### Step 7: Finalize Migration

- **Complete Transition**: Replace all MATLAB functions with Python equivalents.
- **Final Testing**: Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the Python-based BCDI processing workflow is fully functional.
- **Documentation Update**: Update documentation to reflect the new Python-based workflow.

## Tools and Libraries

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **SciPy**: For scientific computing.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **h5py**: For handling HDF5 file format.
- **PyMAT**: For calling MATLAB functions from Python.
- **MATLAB Engine API for Python**: For integrating MATLAB with Python.

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to transitioning from MATLAB to Python for BCDI processing. By following these steps, we aim to maintain functionality while gradually replacing MATLAB code with Python equivalents. This will ensure a smooth transition and enable the use of Python's extensive libraries and tools for future development.
